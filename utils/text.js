  `Hey, it's Fred! I am a self-taught software developer with a background in physiotherapy. 
  I have been practicing full-stack development and AI through various courses and independent practice. 
  I'm not good at explaining what I can do with words, so check out my projects below!`

export const tttDescription = 
  `This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using vanilla TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. 
  It features an AI opponent powered by a depth-limited minimax algorithm optimized with alpha-beta pruning.`

export const tttTech = `TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite`

export const ndDescription = 
  `This project is a full-stack app featuring an AI that predicts the correct label of a given input data. It is built with TypeScript and Python. 
  It features a neural model built with TensorFlow that classifies digits hosted onto a Flask server.`

export const ndTech = "TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite, Python, Flask, TensorFlow, Numpy"

export const shDescription = 
  `This project is a simple Next.js e-shop that makes calls to an external API using SWR to render item characteristics. 
  It includes features like dark and light mode, a shopping cart, and pagination.`

export const shTech = "TypeScript, NextJS, Tailwind, SWR"

export const edcDescription = 
  `This is a fully tested, Django app that simulates a physiotherapy caseload manager for the Emergency Department 
  featuring a full CRUD API, user authentications, multiple error handling and data filtering and manipulation.`

export const ff1 = 
  `I actually made a similar model that recognizes road signs, which is far more impressive, right? 
  So why did I decide to use a digit model for this project? Well, it turns out my dexterity skills need some refinement, 
  and it's far more challenging to draw road signs than to write digits. 
  Long story short, I was embarrassed by my drawings and used digits instead!`

export const ff2 = 
  `Did you know that I'm quite good at yoga? 
  I can do a very good handstand! I was actually a professional ballet dancer, but after an injury, 
  I had to change careers and graduated as a physiotherapist (with honors!). 
  It turns out that when you train as an athlete for 12 years, you get quite good at most sports and disciplines. 
  I can also do a very impressive headstand.`

export const aboutSh = 
  `Yes, I know. I have done this project a while ago and I used the old /src directory instead of the /app directory. 
  But this portfolio is entirely made in NextJS and it is using the latest features!`

export const aboutBe = 
  `Also, I have made other full stack projects using NextJs for the front end and other frameworks for the backend such as Django. 
  I then also discovered that you can use JavaScript for the backend, I had to make stuff using nodeJS and express! I also used Prisma as an ORM.
  Did I catch your attention? Then hurry up and go browse my GitHub!`

  export const theEnd = 
  `Well, this is the end of my website (for now!) but I'm glad you arrived all the way here!
  I am sure you have been impressed by my skills and you'll want to send me an email. I am quite friendly, we can talk about stuff and I can teach you how to do an headstand (it is easy I promise)`

  export const theEndAgain = 
  `If you don't want to send me an email but still want to know more about me then you can either check my GitHub or look me up on linkedIn, 
  just click on the icons on the border of the screen and you'll be magically sent there. Ciao!`
