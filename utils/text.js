  `Hey, it's Fred! I am a self taught software developer coming from a background of Physiotherapy. 
  I have been practicing with full stack development and AI through different courses and independent practice.
  I am not good at explaining what I can do with words so check it out yourself with my projects below!`

export const tttDescription = 
  `This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using vanilla TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, 
  featuring an AI opponent powered by a depth-limited minimax algorithm optimised with alpha-beta pruning.`

export const tttTech = `TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite`

export const ndDescription = 
  `This project is a fullstack app built in TypeScript and Python. 
  On the frontend the user is able to draw a digit into a canvas to then send it to a flask server.  On the backend, the server will then use a neural model built using Tensor flow to predict the digit and return the prediction
  that will then be displayed onto the frontend`

export const ndTech = "TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite, Python, Flask, TensorFlow, Numpy"

export const shDescription = 
  `This project is a simple NextJS e-shop that makes a call to an external API using SWR to render the items name, description, image, price and ratings.
  It uses tailwindCSS and shows features like dark and light mode, a shopping Cart and pagination.`

export const shTech = "TypeScript, NextJS, Tailwind, SWR"

export const ff1 = 
  `I actually made a similar model that recognises road signs, which is far more impressive right? 
  Why did I then decided to use a digit model as a project then? 
  Well turns out my artistic skills need some refinement and it is far more challanging to draw road signs than it is to write digits. 
  Long story short, I was embarased about my drawings and used digits instead!`

export const ff2 = 
  `Did you know that I am quite good at yoga? I can do a very good handstand!
  I actually was a professional ballet dancer, then I got injured so I had to change carreer and graduated as a Physio (with honours!).
  Turns out when you train as an athlete for 12 years you get quite good at most of the sports and disciplines. I can do a very impressive headstand.`

export const aboutSh = 
  `Yes, I know. I have done this project a while ago and I used the old /src directory instead of the /app directory. 
  But this portfolio is entirely made in NextJS and it is using the latest features!`

export const aboutBe = 
  `Also, I have made other full stack project using NextJs for the front end and other frameworks for the backend such as Django. 
  I then also discovered that you can use JavaScript for the backend, I had to make stuff using nodeJS and express! I also used Prisma as an ORM.
  Did i catch your attention? Then hurry up and go browse my GitHub!`

  export const theEnd = 
  `Well, this is the end of my website (for now!) but I'm glad you arrived all the way here!
  I am sure you have been impressed by my skills and you'll want to send me an email. I am quite friendly, we can talk about stuff and I can teach you how to do an headstand (it is easy I promise)`

  export const theEndAgain = 
  `If you don't want to send me an email but still want to know more about me then you can either check my GitHub or look me up on linkedIn, 
  just click on the icons on the border of the screen and you'll be magically sent there!`
